Alison McCondichie - Module 14 - Belly Button Challenge - Interactive Visualizations

The purpose of this project was to build an interactive dashboard with Javascript and D3. The dashbaord found in the index.html file allows users to explore Belly Button Biodiversity information through an interactive dropdown menu. Changing the dropdown options also populates updated information for the Bubble Chart and Bar Chart. 
A link to the official study where the microbiom data was gathered is included on the webpage. This project highlights ability to read in information from an url using D3, then organize and create visuals based on user input interacting with the data.
